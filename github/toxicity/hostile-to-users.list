# 95% of the issue tracker is "closed as duplicate", but it's because the first
# time someone suggests an idea, it gets turned down and discussion locked, so
# nobody can even articulate why it suits their use case. subsequent discussions
# are closed within 30 seconds. honestly feels like the maintainer has no
# interest in building software for other people
