From time to time, on one online service or another, I have to block someone. This repository
contains my lists of blocked users on various sites. It is not (and may never be) complete for all
sites, but I do intend to update it over time.

I have three main motivations for maintaining these lists:
1. Transparency: In some cases, blocking users may prevent them from participating in or benefiting
from work that I intend to do for the public good. In such cases, I would like a record to be
available explaining my reasons for blocking users.
2. Personal recordskeeping: If a situation arises where someone requests to be unblocked, I'd like
to be able to review the original reasons for the block, and most websites' blocking tools do not
provide sufficient context on their own.
3. Sharing: If other users trust my judgement on blocking users and believe that my reasons are
transferrable, they may use my blocklists to augment their own. I try to organize my blocklists by
category, so users who agree with only some of my reasons may choose to use the appropriate subset.
